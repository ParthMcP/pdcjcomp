Project Topic:
Analysis of the video game dataset ‘video_games_sales_as_at_22_dec_2016’ which has been obtained from Kaggle.com.
The dataset describes video games sales of different games over the course of the last 20 years. It has more than 16500 entries. 
It also describes critics and user ratings.

Visualisation:
 

Project Plan:
We plan to analyse the data and report various findings that could help companies that make games to increase sales and know what consumers like. 
To implement our analysis, Hortonworks Sandbox is used to instantiate the Hadoop Cluster. ‘Hive 1.0’ is then used to run SQL queries on the non-relational database.
We will also visualize the results using Hive and Python.
Example:
Let us take an example and find out the year when most games were released.
1.	Open Sandbox in VirtualBox & open the browser to localhost:8080 to access Ambari.
2.	Once the Hadoop Cluster is running, open Hive & upload Dataset. Columns have been renamed for convenience.
3.	Now run the sql query
 
Conclusion: Clearly, the most games were released in 2008.

A pdf Document has been uploaded to visualise this result.

We plan to find more such results by Review 3.
